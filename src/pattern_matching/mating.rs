//! Mate and merge overlapping paired sequences
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use bio::pattern_matching::mating::{mate,merge};
//! let read1 = b"tacgattcgat";
//! let read2 = b"ttcgattacgt";
//! let overlap = mate(read1, read2, 1, 1).unwrap();
//! let contig = merge(read1, read2, overlap);
//! assert_eq!(contig, b"tacgattcgattacgt");
//! ```
//!
//! Mate pair merging procedes in two steps:
//!   mate: identifying the optimal overlap length or rejecting the case
//!   merge: combines overlapping sequences 
//!
//! Mating is governed by an objective function and merging resolves 
//! conflicts between sequences ("mending").
//!
//! We also need to define the scores for which mating is acceptible. The
//! minimum overlap score and minimum overlap length could be guessed
//! from the k-mer distribution.
